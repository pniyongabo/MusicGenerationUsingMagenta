For this project, we used tools built on top of neural networks to generate music. There are several tools out there using pre-trained NN to generate things like music. The most prominent ones are [Tensorflow’s Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) and [OpenAI’s Jukebox](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/). For this project, we used Magenta. Powered by Tensorflow, Magenta is a Python library that can be used for generating images, drawings, and music.
